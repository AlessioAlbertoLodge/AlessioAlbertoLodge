# Hey there! 🌬️👋

I'm Alessio, a wind energy enthusiast and recent graduate from Imperial College London. I hold a Master’s degree in Advanced Mechanical Eningeering where I had the pleasure to develop a pioneering web/based and open-source offshore wind farm modelling software for my thesis project.

The tool is avaiable here: https://aal22.pythonanywhere.com/

The source code is avaiable upon request :earth_africa:

## Master Thesis: "Development of an Evaluation and Prediction Model for Offshore Wind Farms: Performance and Climate Change Impacts"
:zap: My thesis is a testament to my commitment to expediting renewable energy capacity deployment. Through the website, one can evaluate the competitiveness of an offshore wind farm based simply on the chosen type of turbine and its geographical positioning, which will directly influence the attractiveness of the farm. 

🌬️ Indeed, annual energy production (AEP), Capacity Factor (CP) and depth of the farm directly influence the economic feasibility, where the former is optimized to achieve a high capacity factor of ~30-40%, and the latter is limited typically to 50-60 m. The tool also includes the most recent IPCC climate change models, which include a prediction in the reduction/increase in local wind resources: this allowed the implementation of a prediction of the reduction in wind speeds, and hence annual energy production (which are different because to the non-linear dependency) due toclimate change forced wind stilling.

:sparkles: The application was also expanded to include an additional functionality, named "Exploration", in which an optimized wind farm (in terms of position, layout and wind turbine) is presented to the user to satisfy an installed capacity target. The tool identifies the most productive location for an inputted region of water and wind turbine selection while satisfying constraints of bathymetric depth.

:trophy: By leveraging the source code, offshore wind was also proven as a climate change resilient technology. By modelling the UK's Offshore Wind Farm fleet, one of the largest and most advanced worldwide (including the largest offshore wind farm in the world), it was shown how even in the most severe warming scenarios, corresponding to SSP5, AEP of the entire fleet would decrease by only 4%.

## 🎓 Skills Developed
- **Web Development**: Leveraged HTML and CSS to design a user-friendly interface for the wind farm model website.
- **Simulation and Modeling**: Developed low-order wake effect models to simulate wind distribution within the farms based on layout, turbine selection and wind resource  
- **Programming**: Developed on Python, the open-source and data-science-prone language was crucial for the successful outcome of the project. I improved my proficiency by utilising novel libraries for GIS data processing, statistical analysis
-  **Software Development**: Created the web-based application by exploiting best practice software development structures and pipelines.
- **Data Analysis**: Conducted extensive data analysis to validate the simulation results, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
- **API Data Management**: Implemented automatic wind speed data querying, enabling the code to communicate via API to online wind speed databases (ERA5 Reanalysis), based on user inputs, to obtain historical wind speeds
- **Optimization**: Implemented optimization algorithms to enhance the Capacity Factor (CF) of wind farms within the simulation.
- **Time Series (Weather) Forecasting**: Having to predict the future and coordinate specific wind resources, I learnt about statistical and ML time series forecasting.



- ## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
- **Overview of Worldwide Renewable Energy Targets and Net-Zero Trajectories**: This work was motivated by the global need to transition to clean energy. In the world of IRENA, "Renewables are the backbone of any energy transition to achieve net zero". To showcase the importance of this work, an initial context was provided presenting the current climate pledges, renewable capacity targets and Net Zero Trajectories.
- **Strong understanding of Offshore Wind Technology, Policies and Trends**: Naturally, this project brought me to understand the working principles of wind turbines, wind turbine and farm technology, the current offshore wind sector practices and future trends.
